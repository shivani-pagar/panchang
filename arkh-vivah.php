												<h3 class="pbmit-title" >Arkh Vivah Pooja At Trimbakeshwar</h3>
											
												<p>This puja is done at mangalnath temple in Trimbakeshwar.</p>
												
												<p>The highest degree of this Manglik dosh is formed when mars is placed in ascendant or the seventh house. These two placements form two most severe manglik dosh out of which placement in seventh is the most severe of all. Next in severity in decreasing order come the mars in eighth house, then forth and then twelfth house. In addition to mars, Sun, Saturn, Rahu and ketu’s placement in the houses mentioned above also forms partial Manglik dosh. So it is prefer to do Arkh vivah pooja at trimbakeshwar.</p>
												
												<p>Why Mars causes this Dosh ? Mars is considered the most malific planet as far as marriage of a person is considered. Mars is a fierce planet and its placement in certain houses results in Mangalik dosha. Marriage is considered as one of the most auspicious ceremony. In hindi the word Manglik denotes auspiciousness. Hence a manglik dosha makes the even inauspicious or causes problems in this event.</p>
												
											<p>What are the effects of Manglik Dosha ? The most common effect of Manglik dosha is - Delay in Marriage. </p>

                                        <p>Manglik dosha causes the marriage to be solemnized as late as at the age of 34 years, 38 years and even in 40s.</p>

                                        <p>Apart from this if a manglik boy/girl is married to a non-manglik spouse then the event of death or severe accidents have been witnessed by many couples which lead to death, permanent disability of the non-manglik spouse.</p>

												<h3 class="pbmit-title" >About Trimbakeshwar in Nashik</h3>
												<p class="text-justify">Shri Trimbakeshwar Temple is located at a distance of about 30-km from Nasik in Maharashtra near the mountain named Brahmagiri from which the river Godavari flows. Trimbakeshwar Temple is revered as one of the 12 Jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva and as the source of the river Godavari. Just as Ganga is known as Bhagirathi and is one of the most important rivers in North India, in the same way, Godavari is also known as Gautami Ganga and is the most sacred river in South India. According to Shiv Purana, it is because of the earnest request of Godavari, Gautam Rishi and other gods that Lord Shiva agreed to reside here and assumed the famous name Trimbakeshwar. Interestingly, locals refer to the river here as Ganga and not as Godavari. All the heavenly Gods promised to come down to Nasik, once in twelve years, when Jupiter resides in the zodiac sign of Leo. A grand fair is organized at this place. Devotees take a holy bath in the Gautami Ganga and then seek the blessings of Trimbakeshwar.</p>
